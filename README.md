My solutions to problems on the [UVa Online Judge](http://uva.onlinejudge.org). This repository exists to get me to solve these problems regularly, because now I have a public commitment sitting right here in my GitHub.

Detailed statistics are available on my [uHunt profile](http://uhunt.felix-halim.net/id/171034) (since that page is not worth anyone's time yet, this is another motivation for me -- to improve my statistics enough that I'm not altogether ashamed of them).
